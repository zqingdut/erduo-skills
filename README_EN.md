## ✨ Featured Skill: Daily News Report

The **Daily News Report** is a sophisticated skill designed to autonomously fetch, filter, and summarize high-quality technical news from multiple sources.

### 🏗 Architecture

This skill utilizes a **Master-Worker** architecture with a smart orchestrator and specialized sub-agents.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User((User)) -->|Start| Master[Master Agent<br>Orchestrate/Monitor/Decide]
    
    subgraph Execution Layer [SubAgent Layer]
        WorkerA[Worker A<br>WebFetch]
        WorkerB[Worker B<br>WebFetch]
        Browser[Browser Worker<br>Headless Chrome]
    end

    Master -->|Dispatch Tier 1| WorkerA
    Master -->|Dispatch Tier 2| WorkerB
    Master -->|Dispatch JS Pages| Browser

    WorkerB -->|Result| Master
    Browser -->|Result| Master

    Master -->|Filter & Dedup| Report[Generate Report]
    Master -->|Update| Cache[Smart Cache]
```

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Source Fetching**:
  - Aggregates content from HackerNews, HuggingFace Papers, etc.
  
- **Smart Filtering**:
  - Filters for high-quality technical content, excluding marketing fluff.
  
- **Dynamic Scheduling**:
  - Uses an "Early Stopping" mechanism: if enough high-quality items are found (e.g., 20 items), it stops fetching to save resources.

- **Headless Browser Support**:
  - Handles complex, JS-rendered pages (e.g., ProductHunt) using MCP Chrome DevTools.

### 📄 Output Example

Reports are generated in structured Markdown format, stored in the `NewsReport/` directory.
